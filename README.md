The aim of this project is to predict the loan approval of applicants.
Banking Industry always needs a more accurate predictive modelling
system for many issues. Predicting credit defaulters is a difficult task
for the banking industry. The loan status is one of the quality
indicators of the loan. It doesn't show everything immediately, but it
is a first step of the loan lending process. The loan status is used for
creating a credit scoring model. The credit scoring model is used for
accurate analysis of credit data to find defaulters and valid customers.
The objective of this paper is to create a credit scoring model for
credit data. Various machine learning techniques are used to develop
the financial credit scoring model. In this project, we will train and
test the data using machine learning algorithms like Logistic
Regression, Random forest and Decision tree and then choose the
model which provides the important information with the highest
accuracy. It is used to predict the loan status in commercial banks
using machine learning classifiers.
